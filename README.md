# 🚀 Streamlit-SurvivalPredictor  

A machine learning-powered web application built with **Streamlit** to predict passenger survival based on various factors such as age, gender, seat type, and fare paid.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ User-friendly web interface with **Streamlit**  
✅ Accepts passenger details as input  
✅ Converts categorical values into numerical format  
✅ Uses a trained **machine learning model** for predictions  
✅ Displays survival probability in real-time  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Streamlit** (for UI)  
- **Pandas**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **Pickle** (for model storage)
